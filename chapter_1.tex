\label{chap:chapter_1}

With the approaching of the High Luminosity era for the LHC accelerator, it is time to make a comprehensive study of the possible updated measurements that can be performed. In particular, focusing on Higgs physics, it is of primary importance the study of possible tests on the theory, and this can be done by studying the self-coupling of the Higgs boson, in a non-resonant hypothesis. In particular, the self-coupling provides access to indirect measurements of the Higgs potential field.

First, this study reproduces a previous analysis from the CMS experiment using Monte Carlo samples from Run2, and then extends the analysis to Phase2 using the framework Flashsim.
